Sharelet

## Mission
I love Android Intents, meaning I can open a resource in every app that supports that kind of resource, but I miss this feature on the desktop browser.
- What if I want to share a web page with my friends on Facebook? I should copy the page address, go to Facebook, create a post and paste the address in.
- And if I want to save that page on [Pocket](http://getpocket.com/)? Well, I could use their [extension](https://getpocket.com/add) (or bookmarklet).
- And if I want to share it with [Buffer](https://bufferapp.com)? Well, I could install their [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/buffer/noojglkidnpfjbincgijbaiedldjfbhh).
- And what if... maybe you got that.

Long story short, to use all the services I daily use to share/save/whatever links I would have a lot of extensions and bookmarklets installed on the browser, meaning space on my pc and resource consumption for every page visited (since most of the extensions do a lot of work every time you navigate through the web).

What I needed was a single bookmarklet (not an extension) that could give me a rapid access to all the actions that I could do with a web page.

## To Do
* custom reordering of intents
* adding custom intents
* filtering of intents based on url RegExp
* create parametric intents (like *email to someone specific*, or *create post on wordpress X or wordpress Y*)
* QR encoded url in the "current url" header
* switch to Vanilla Javascript (instead of AngularJS)?
* embedding in web pages
  * media query on height to show just the icons horizontally
